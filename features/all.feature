		When I run `nanosh` interactively
		And I type "cd mysubdir"
		And I type "pwd"
		And I type "exit"
		And the stdout should contain "mysubdir"
		And the stdout should contain "nanosh: nanosh: "
		Then 10 points are awarded

	Scenario: nanosh cd without parms should cd to the home directory

		And I type "cd mysubdir"
		And I type "cd"
		And I type "pwd"
		And I type "exit"
		And the output should contain HOME
		And the output should not contain "mysubdir"
		Then 20 points are awarded

	Scenario: nanosh cd with > 1 parm should issue perror with EINVAL
		When I run `nanosh` interactively

		And the stdout should contain exactly "nanosh: nanosh: "
		And the stderr should contain "Invalid argument"
		Then 10 points are awarded

	Scenario: nanosh cd to a nonexitent dir should issue perror 
		When I run `nanosh` interactively
		And I type "cd A_TOTALLY_NONEXISTENT_DIRECTORY"
		And I type "exit"
		And the stdout should contain exactly "nanosh: nanosh: "
		And the stderr should contain "No such file or directory"

		And the output should contain "U fork"
		And the output should contain "U execvp"
		Given a file named "testdata" with:
		"""
		I am your father

		"""
		And I run `nanosh` interactively
		And I type "cat testdata"
		And I type "exit"
		And the stdout should contain "I am your father\n"
		Then 10 points are awarded

	Scenario: nanosh CMD should call waitpid()
